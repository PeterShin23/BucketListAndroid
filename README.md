### Features beyond requirements
Added a delete button

As a design decision, I made completed date be based only on when the checkbox is pressed and only alterable if the checkbox is unpressed and pressed again. If I were to have implemented it such that the completed date has a datepicker similar to that of due date, I would follow the same format as I do for allowing change to the due date.


### Takeways from project.
It was really fun learning how to use Kotlin as it was very intuitive once I got the hang of it. The room database is extremely useful, and also very intuitive. The thing that took the longest to understand was how to use the adapter. What was most frustrating about it was that I didn't necessarily understand why some parts of it were so verbose such as the setting onclicklistener() parts. However, after understanding how the bind view worked in conjunction to the card view, it made a lot of sense. If I were to go back and redo this app, I would take more time to understand what each part of the adapter did; as it is right now, it is very simplistic. Overall, I'm happy with my final product.
