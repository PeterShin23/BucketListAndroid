### Takeways from project.
It was really fun learning how to use Kotlin as it was very intuitive once I got the hang of it. The room database is extremely useful, and also very intuitive. The thing that took the longest to understand was how to use the adapter. What was most frustrating about it was that I didn't necessarily understand why some parts of it are very verbose such as the setting onclicklistener() parts. However, after understand how the bind view worked in conjunction to the card view, it made a lot of sense. If I were to go back and redo this app, I would take more time to understand what each part of the adapter did; as it is right now, it is very simplistic. Overall, I'm happy with my final product.
